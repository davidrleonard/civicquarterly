# Civic Quarterly

Government is changing. Let's talk about it.

## Mission statement

Civic Quartlery is a snapshot of the civic hacking movement. Its makers want to push forward the conversation about what government should be. We believe strongly that a movement to reform government should be informed, deliberate and transparent. We believe technology can be an important tool to aid this movement.

## What does 'push the conversation forward' mean?

We want our writing and visuals to form a constructive conversation about how government can be improved. Our reporting and opinions should always be balanced and clearly written. [What else?]

## What will you actually publish?

That's a hard question. We're always evolving. These are some common threads you will see:

* In-depth explainer articles tracking specific civic hacking movements and figures. 
* First-person narratives from the field that show how things are getting done. 
* Informed opinions from civic hackers that add to the conversation.
* Practical how-to guides on user research, creating tech solutions for government, redeploying civic apps, and other interesting topics.
* Letters-to-the-editor: Short dispatches from readers reacting to content and the movement.

Have more ideas? Please let us know.

## Who reads it?

Our target audience is the community of thinkers and makers working to making government work for the people. This includes government officials, civic hackers, and anyone who is interested in improving the civic space.

## Who makes it?

This publication is currently building out a staff of volunteer writers, editors, and designers. Contact editor David Leonard if you'd like to be involved.

# Practical considerations

## How can I read Civic Quarterly?

We will regularly produce a web magazine and quarterly print journal.

The print journal is intended to be an in-depth review of the movement its direction. Its focus is on sorting through lots of information to create a digestable story about the movement of civic hacking and better government. The writing and visuals will be evergreen. Think of it like a coffee table book: pick it up anytime, dive in and follow the thread of civic betterment.

The website will provide a similar experience. It will not sacrifice naunce and depth to make the information more bite-sized. But it will take into account how readers use information on the web, and provide interactive and hands-on content that improves the experience. Think interactive graphics, coding tutorials that include an emualtor to see if you're actually getting the steps right, and video that adds depth to a piece. The website will focus on providing a unique destination for each article, rather than an it-can-do-anything platform to catch any and all content.

## What is the your style?

There's no in-house style guide yet. We will follow AP Style for consistency, but not religiously. We don't mind depating from AP Style to make a concept more easy to understand.

Our writing will avoid flourish, and seek to be simple and direct. We believe strongly that we should show, not tell, and let our ideas and sources speak for themselves. Think of a marriage between The New York Times Magazine and WIRED: not afraid to be wonky sometimes, but always breaking concepts down so anyone can understand them.

## What's the editing process?

We haven't completely figured that part out. We will use GitHub to plan, edit and track written pieces.
